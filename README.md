# cycleGAN_image_to_weights
The aim of the project is to exploit the cycleGAN architecture to compute the trajectories for a Franka Emika robot to reach a ripe strawberry. The trajectories will be computed retrieving the weights from the GAN architecture and applying the Movement Primitive approach
